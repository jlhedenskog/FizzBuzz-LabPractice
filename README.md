# CSharp FizzBuzz
 
FizzBuzz is a program that prints numbers 1 - 100. It will allow the user to enter two numeric inputs as input 1 and input 2. However, for multiples of the first user input, it will print "Fizz" and for multiples of the second user input, it will print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both the first and second input, it will print "FizzBuzz".
